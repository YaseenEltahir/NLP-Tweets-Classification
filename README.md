# NLP-Tweets-Classification

Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets
Twitter has become an important communication channel in times of emergency. 
But, it’s not always clear whether a person’s tweet/words are actually announcing a disaster. 
Our task is to develop a machine learning system that can correctly classify whether a given tweet is reporting a real disaster or not.
